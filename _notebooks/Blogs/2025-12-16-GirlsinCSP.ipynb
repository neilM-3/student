    "## Summary\n",
    "Reworded interview notes capturing the interviewee’s motivation for their major, how high school prepared them, teamwork/process habits, and advice for students entering CS.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Major Inspiration / Why They Chose the Major\n",
    "- Grew up in/near the Bay Area, so exposure to tech played a role early on.\n",
    "- Mentioned Legos as an early influence: enjoying creativity and building things from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## High School Preparation for College-Level Work\n",
    "- Stressed that communication is essential.\n",
    "- Writing documentation/reports helped them practice clearly explaining technical work.\n",
    "- Participated in CyberPatriot, which helped them become more comfortable with computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breaking Down Big Problems\n",
    "- Said decomposing large tasks into smaller steps is a major skill in their field.\n",
    "- Example: splitting essays into steps to make work manageable.\n",
    "- Example: dividing projects by components (e.g., frontend vs backend) and assigning owners to reduce workload and stay organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrospectives / Project Reviews\n",
    "- Has done retrospectives/reviews and found them valuable for identifying what worked, what didn’t, and what to change next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenging Technical/Engineering Problem + Approach\n",
    "- Highlighted the difficulty of managing large projects/heavy workloads.\n",
    "- Approach: break the project into clear parts, delegate responsibilities, and coordinate regularly so the pieces still fit together.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Ideas + Creativity vs Constraints\n",
    "- Uses user research to generate ideas and guide decisions.\n",
    "- Emphasizes a “users first” mindset.\n",
    "- Noted internships often provide fewer creative choices since tasks are assigned.\n",
    "- In class/personal projects, they have more freedom—still improved work by observing user behavior and iterating based on feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strongest Part of Their College Application\n",
    "- Focused on growth and what they learned in high school.\n",
    "- Connected their experiences to why they were a good match for the colleges they applied to.\n",
    "- Included personal story elements and impact on others (e.g., starting a nonprofit / working with other organizations).\n",
    "- Framed CS interest around exploration, learning, and helping others through what they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Most Valuable Skills from High School + What They Wish They Learned Earlier\n",
    "- STEM classes built lasting skills: time management, teamwork, communication, and mindset.\n",
    "- Emphasized grit and the ability to work hard.\n",
    "- Said a rigorous school environment helped them handle later challenges.\n",
    "- Wishes they learned earlier how to take initiative with the freedom given in projects.\n",
    "- Mentioned learning to use resources effectively (Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, etc.) and being proactive about solving problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication in Projects (Talk-Throughs, Diagrams, Documentation)\n",
    "- Talking through code helps align the team and clarify ideas.\n",
    "- AI tools can support understanding or debugging code.\n",
    "- Diagrams/flowcharts help visualize systems and improve clarity.\n",
    "- Sharing written docs about new concepts helps the rest of the team ramp up faster.\n",
    "- Keeping user needs in mind supports clearer communication and better decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agile/Scrum + Teamwork\n",
    "- Has used agile/scrum-like methods and found they help structure work.\n",
    "- These methods support organizing people and breaking tasks into manageable chunks.\n",
    "- Reported both challenges and successes in team settings; earlier group projects helped prepare them for college teamwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advice Shared\n",
    "- Stay updated on new CS developments since the field changes quickly and spans many areas.\n",
    "- Lower stress and staying relaxed can improve learning and understanding.\n",
    "- “If you really want something, you can achieve it.”\n",
    "- Try new things while you still can and say yes to opportunities.\n",
    "- Take advantage of project-based classes and the freedom they provide.\n",
