    "# CSP Goals & Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals (what I want to achieve)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Build real systems intuition\n",
    "- Explain what’s actually happening when code runs (memory, stack vs heap, pointers/references, processes/threads, I/O).\n",
    "- Predict where/why things break instead of relying on trial-and-error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Become strong at debugging\n",
    "- Use a consistent workflow: reproduce → isolate → hypothesize → test → fix → verify.\n",
    "- Get comfortable with debugging tools (debugger, sanitizers, logging, unit tests) and reading error messages precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Write clean, correct code under constraints\n",
    "- Prioritize correctness first, then efficiency, then style.\n",
    "- Handle edge cases well and reason using invariants, preconditions, and postconditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Level up in C (or low-level programming)\n",
    "- Understand pointers deeply: aliasing, lifetime, ownership, segfaults, undefined behavior.\n",
    "- Confidently work with arrays/strings, structs, and dynamic memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Master asymptotic + practical performance\n",
    "- Use Big-O to compare approaches, and also identify real bottlenecks in practice.\n",
    "- Know when an approach is too slow before coding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Get good at reading and modifying existing code\n",
    "- Quickly answer: “what calls what?”, “where is state stored?”, “what are the data structures?”, and “what assumptions exist?”\n",
    "- Make changes without breaking unrelated behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Ship projects like an engineer\n",
    "- Produce work that passes tests, follows specs, handles inputs correctly, and is explainable.\n",
    "- Build the habit of testing early and often.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Expectations (how I’ll operate week-to-week)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) I don’t aim for “I get it when I see the solution.”\n",
    "- I aim for: “I can derive the solution from first principles.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Every assignment becomes a skill drill\n",
    "Each homework/project should produce:\n",
    "- 1 debugging lesson I write down\n",
    "- 1 reusable pattern (parsing, memory handling, ADTs, recursion, etc.)\n",
    "- 1 common mistake I won’t repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) I actively practice, not passively read\n",
    "- For every concept: do a tiny implementation (10–30 minutes) that forces me to use it.\n",
    "- If I can’t implement it from scratch, I don’t “know” it yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) I have a minimum standard before submitting\n",
    "Before turning anything in, I will:\n",
    "- Pass all provided tests and write 3–5 of my own\n",
    "- Test edge cases (empty input, size 1, max size, unusual input)\n",
    "- Use sanitizers / memory checks if applicable\n",
    "- Re-read the spec and verify every requirement explicitly\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) I track weak points aggressively\n",
    "- Keep a running “CSP mistakes list” (bugs, concepts, patterns).\n",
    "- Review it weekly and intentionally practice the top 1–2 weak points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) I communicate like a software engineer\n",
    "- In writeups, comments, and explanations, I focus on:\n",
    "  - What I built\n",
    "  - Why I built it this way\n",
    "  - How I know it works (tests + reasoning)\n",
