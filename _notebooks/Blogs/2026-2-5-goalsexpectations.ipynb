    "## Goals (what I want to achieve)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Build real systems intuition\n",
    "- Explain what’s actually happening when code runs (memory, stack vs heap, pointers/references, processes/threads, I/O).\n",
    "- Predict where/why things break instead of relying on trial-and-error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Become strong at debugging\n",
    "- Use a consistent workflow: reproduce → isolate → hypothesize → test → fix → verify.\n",
    "- Get comfortable with debugging tools (debugger, sanitizers, logging, unit tests) and reading error messages precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Write clean, correct code under constraints\n",
    "- Prioritize correctness first, then efficiency, then style.\n",
    "- Handle edge cases well and reason using invariants, preconditions, and postconditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Level up in C (or low-level programming)\n",
    "- Understand pointers deeply: aliasing, lifetime, ownership, segfaults, undefined behavior.\n",
    "- Confidently work with arrays/strings, structs, and dynamic memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Master asymptotic + practical performance\n",
    "- Use Big-O to compare approaches, and also identify real bottlenecks in practice.\n",
    "- Know when an approach is too slow before coding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Get good at reading and modifying existing code\n",
    "- Quickly answer: “what calls what?”, “where is state stored?”, “what are the data structures?”, and “what assumptions exist?”\n",
    "- Make changes without breaking unrelated behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Ship projects like an engineer\n",
    "- Produce work that passes tests, follows specs, handles inputs correctly, and is explainable.\n",
    "- Build the habit of testing early and often.\n",
