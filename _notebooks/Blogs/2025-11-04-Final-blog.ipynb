    "## 1. How Much I Have Grown Since The Start of The Year \n",
    "\n",
    "### Beginning of Year (August/September):\n",
    "- I didnt even know how to open Jupyter Notebooks, and commit on VSCode\n",
    "- I Barely knew how to code. Python was confusing and I struggled with basic syntax\n",
    "- Was nervous about coding projects and needed a lot of help\n",
    "- I wasn't confident presenting my work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now (November):\n",
    "- I helped create my API sports submodule, which was cool with different stadiums and gathering data.\n",
    "- I understand frontend and backend development\n",
    "- I'm more confident with my own code and require less help then before, but at the same time require it when I need\n",
    "- I enjoy learning when I understand how to do it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth:** From being scared to code to building real projects with groups\n",
    "- I think that this is amazing, doing projects like these because in the future like I told you in the beggining of the trimester in Sprint Check 1. I am planning to persue some stem majored class. Mostly Data Science related, like AI and Machine learning. So everything we learned is contributing to the factor of persuing this in the future..\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Sprint 2 - Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python:\n",
    "- Mastered Python basics: variables, loops, conditionals, functions\n",
    "- Learned JavaScript for interactive web pages\n",
    "- Built interactive features using both languages\n",
    "- Taught Strings and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework Examples from Python what I learned from all of these assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.1 Variables & Assignments - You learned how to store information in variables, like putting a label on a box to remember what's inside.\n",
    "# 3.2 Data Abstraction - You learned how to organize and group related data together to make it easier to work with.\n",
    "# 3.3 Mathematical Expressions - You learned how to do math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in Python.\n",
    "# 3.4 Strings - You learned how to work with text (words and sentences) in your code.\n",
    "# 3.5 Boolean Expressions - You learned how to create true/false statements to help your program make decisions.\n",
    "# 3.6 Conditionals - You learned how to make your program do different things based on conditions, like \"if this is true, then do that.\"\n",
    "# 3.7 Nested Conditionals - You learned how to put if-statements inside other if-statements for more complex decisions.\n",
    "# 3.8 Iteration - You learned how to repeat actions multiple times using loops instead of writing the same code over and over.\n",
    "# 3.9 Developing Algorithms - You learned how to create step-by-step instructions to solve problems.\n",
    "# 3.10 Lists - You learned how to store multiple items in one variable, like a shopping list.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. How N@tM Went\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Experience:\n",
    "- We presented the West Coast project in which we explained Sports API's\n",
    "- I was nervous but felt proud showing what I built\n",
    "- Many people visited my station\n",
    "- It was very fun gathering everyone and doing interactive MCQ's for our submodules.\n",

    "### New Features:\n",
    "- Add more interactive buttons and animations to make it fun\n",
    "- Add a dark mode option for easier reading at night\n",
    "- Let users share their work with friends\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. What I Want to Learn Next in CompSci\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Skills:**\n",
    "- Python programming the main language used for AI and machine learning\n",
    "- Working with data and datasets learning how to organize, clean, and analyze large amounts of information\n",
    "- Basic math for AI understanding statistics and how computers learn patterns from data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts: To help with machine learning and AI in the future**\n",
    "- How neural networks work - understanding how AI brains learn and make decisions\n",
    "- Training AI models - learning how to teach computers to recognize patterns and make predictions\n",
    "- Real-world AI applications - exploring how AI is used in games, apps, and everyday technology\n",

    "\n",
    "**My Score:** 40/66\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Went Well:**\n",
    "- Strong in loops and conditionals\n",
    "- Understood list and array manipulation\n",
    "- Good at logic problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I Struggled With:**\n",
    "- Algorithms & Logic \n",
    "- Procedures & Functions\n",
    "- Data & Compression \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**These are all of the problems I got wrong**\n",
    "- Q6  \n",
    "- Q9  \n",
    "- Q12 \n",
    "- Q21 \n",
    "- Q22 \n",
    "- Q24 \n",
    "- Q25 \n",
    "- Q29 \n",
    "- Q30 \n",
    "- Q33 \n",
    "- Q34 \n",
    "- Q35 \n",
    "- Q38 \n",
    "- Q41 \n",

    "- Q64 \n",
    "- Q65 \n",
    "- Q66 \n",
    "**Corrections:**\n",
    "- I rushed through problems without carefully tracing step-by-step through algorithms, loops, and logic gates, which caused me to get the wrong answers. I also struggled with counting compression savings, understanding binary number limits, and knowing how procedures work together. Additionally, I need to learn more about Internet organizations like (IETF) Internet Engineering Task Force and copyright laws. Next time, I'll slow down and follow each step carefully, practice more with logic problems, and review basic computer science concepts to do better on exams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Approach Going Forward:**\n",
    "- Practice 5-10 MCQ questions daily\n",
    "- Review CollegeBoard study materials weekly\n",
    "- Work on weak areas systematically\n",
    "- This will very much help me on AP Exam\n",

    "## 8. Something Cool I'd Like to Share\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Coolest Achievement:\n",
    "- Working on Interactive MCQ's for Java and Python Hw\n",
    "- Learning Way more about the class and making websites with groups\n",
    "### Why It's Cool:\n",
    "- It taught me how real web applications work behind the scenes.\n",
    "- Made it fun for everyone else\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Taught Me:\n",
    "The more I work and try to understand, the better the impact will be in my learning process. I spent hours debugging, but the feeling when it finally worked was incredible. I learned that being a developer means being comfortable with not knowing everything and learning as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This trimester has been an incredible journey of growth. I went from barely understanding Python syntax to building web applications. I'm excited to continue learning and building even more complex projects. Thanks Mr. Mort for these group projects and allowing me to collaborate with my classmates for an amazing experience!\n",
