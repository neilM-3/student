    "## 1. How Much I Have Grown Since The Start of The Year \n",
    "\n",
    "### Beginning of Year (August/September):\n",
    "- I didnt even know how to open Jupyter Notebooks, and commit on VSCode\n",
    "- I Barely knew how to code. Python was confusing and I struggled with basic syntax\n",
    "- Was nervous about coding projects and needed a lot of help\n",
    "- I wasn't confident presenting my work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now (November):\n",
    "- I helped create my API sports submodule, which was cool with different stadiums and gathering data.\n",
    "- I understand frontend and backend development\n",
    "- I'm more confident with my own code and require less help then before, but at the same time require it when I need\n",
    "- I enjoy learning when I understand how to do it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth:** From being scared to code to building real projects with groups\n",
    "- I think that this is amazing, doing projects like these because in the future like I told you in the beggining of the trimester in Sprint Check 1. I am planning to persue some stem majored class. Mostly Data Science related, like AI and Machine learning. So everything we learned is contributing to the factor of persuing this in the future..\n",

    "## 8. Something Cool I'd Like to Share\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Coolest Achievement:\n",
    "Successfully implemented a working backend API that handles user data and connects to our frontend! This was challenging because I had to learn about routing and databases all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It's Cool:\n",
    "It taught me how real web applications work behind the scenes. I now understand what happens when I log into websites or save data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Taught Me:\n",
    "The more I work and try to understand, the better the impact will be in my learning process. I spent hours debugging, but the feeling when it finally worked was incredible. I learned that being a developer means being comfortable with not knowing everything and learning as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This trimester has been an incredible journey of growth. I went from barely understanding Python syntax to building web applications. I'm excited to continue learning and building even more complex projects. Thanks Mr. Mort for these group projects and allowing me to collaborate with my classmates for an amazing experience!\n",
