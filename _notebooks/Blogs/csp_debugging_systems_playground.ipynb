    "- **Small experiments only** (5–30 min each). No huge projects.\n",
    "- Every experiment must end with a **Takeaway** and **Next time** note.\n",
    "- If something breaks, I write the **exact error** + **root cause** + **how I confirmed**.\n",

    "- **Tool focus:** (e.g., gdb / sanitizers / valgrind)\n",
    "- **Output:** (e.g., 5 drills + 2 bug writeups)"
